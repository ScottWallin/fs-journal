# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? I understand Vue better than I expected. MVC is making sense and the connections are there and it feels good to make them. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? How simple Vue is. After the last couple weeks, everything has felt super complicated. Vue has felt difficult to learn, but manageable. 
- What are you struggling with? Still burnout. There wasn't much lab time this week sadly so I don't feel as confident with Vue itself as i'd like to. I had a good tutoring session though where we talked about my burnout, how to take notes, and how to help find focus.
- What would you count as a victory? I don't quite know. the last couple weeks have felt like i'm keeping my head above water, but not finding victory.
