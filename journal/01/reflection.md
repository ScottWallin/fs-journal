# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? I feel much more confident in myself now than I did Monday. Monday my stress level was around a 9. Now, it's around a 5 or 6 and I'm more excited than nervous. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? The amount of <div>'s we'll have to use. I didn't know much about this coming in, so all of it is pretty much surprising. 
- What are you struggling with? Familiarity with Bootstrap. That will take a lot more practice to get down since it's still so new, but it'll be nice to get to the point of finding comfort with it. 
- What would you count as a victory? The growth i've had in the first week alone. Looking at my site that was done on the first day, compared to the one Abdul and I did yesterday, there's miles of improvement.
