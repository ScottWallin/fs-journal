# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> | Inheritance is when an attribute is inherited from a parent class. It inherits the values, attributes, and instances of all relationships within the parent class. |

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> | It allows creating a single instance of a class to be used then gives a single point to access it. |

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> | it's a pattern where the object (subjects in observer patterns) has a list of dependents. These dependents are notified of any state changes by a variety of methods, mainly by calling a method they have.   |

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> | This design pattern allows you to dynamically change the behavior of an object by encapsulating it into different strategies. this way, the object can have multiple algorithms and behaviors to choose from when it runs, instead of just choosing a single one.|

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> | This design pattern only triggers when the component needs to be rendered and cache what's made for future renders. This one asynchronously revolves the component definition so component can be chosen differently with each render. |

06. What is test driven development?

> | Instead of writing code then testing it, this is where the test is written first and the code is written to make the test pass. It's a slower way to code, but it's more reliable and helps you catch the bugs earlier on. |

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> | Definition of Done. It works within the entire team's understanding of what "done means" for them. It provides a shared understanding of what work was done during the Increment. If the backlog doesn't meet the DoD, then it can't be released or presented during the Review. It has to go back to be finished according to the DoD guidelines.  |

08. Give two examples of a user story:

> | This is the smallest unit of work within the agile framework. It's an informal and general explanation of the software feature written from the perspective of the user or customer. As a student, I want to have easier access to tutoring. As a snowboarder, I want to have a smoother way to build group rides. |

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> | This is created during the sprint planning session. The backlog is consulted by the team which contains a list of all the features and bug fixes that are desired which the team can select from to determine what they accomplish during the sprint.|

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?
