# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? I'm not too sure. This week i feel very lost. I feel like there's an inkling of understanding to it, but not as much as what came with the previous couple weeks. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? Everything. The MVC layout was great to learn because in theory it makes sense for how it all works together. It's a simple idea but learning the execution feels like a monumental climb.
- What are you struggling with? A lot honestly. MVC was a big challenge. Learning what goes where and the ordering of things is confusing. 
- What would you count as a victory? I survived. In each of my projects this week. i was able to get the consoles to log and get at least an image or form on the page and working. small win but still a win.
