# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > | Encapsulation, Polymorphism, & Inheritance |

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > | PUblic variables, functions, and classes are all sent out using export. This way they can be accessed using other areas of code like with the controller or service. export default is used to export a singular value. |

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > | It's a way to restrict access to certain variables or values so not everyone can see the entirety of it.|

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > | It helps us view objects and functions to ensure they're working properly. They also allow us to access them through get or set. |

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > | classes describe the object's behavior and information. the instance of the class is an actual object that can be used like a constructor. |

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > | They are properties that allow you to usethe values of expressions as the names of properties on an object. |

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > | Proper organization and utilization of the coding space. Everything is laid out in a clear way to make sense for the building of the application and for maintenance.  |

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > | Controller handles the input and updates the DOM based on what input commands were given.  |

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > | To hold the business logic in our app. It's the brains of the operation and handles all of the direction of inputs from the controller and information brought in from the appstate and model. |

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > | This handles the layout of the data. The arrays and the look of the information.|
