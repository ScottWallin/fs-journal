# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? I'm not too sure. This week was rough. I'm grasping the concept of how JavaScript works, but I am nervous for this checkpoint.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? How difficult js is. When we did BalloonPop, it seemed like it was gonna be complicated, but not as complicated as this week has been. 
- What are you struggling with? A lot of the concepts from this week. I'm probably beating myself up too much with this, and am just overthinking it, but js as a whole with functions is feeling daunting. 
- What would you count as a victory? I survived. Some of js is making sense to me and the tutoring session helped me understand functions and parameters/arguments better for sure.
