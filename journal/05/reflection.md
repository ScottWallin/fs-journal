# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? Not too sure. The burnout this week was real. I'm hoping this long weekened will help me reset. But the server is making sense to me at least. I'm still struggling with some of the terminology and processes though and that's a little worrisome. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? how simple the service is. i thought the service side of things would be much more in depth. I was surprised how simple it is and how similar it is to the front end. 
- What are you struggling with? Motivation, some terminology and processes, and burn out. working on them though. 
- What would you count as a victory? i was able to push myself wednesdays and get through some of the burnout and it was making sense to me.
