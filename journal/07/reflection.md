# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? I understood the process and flow of the back end more than I expected to. I think I prefer that to the front end though
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? How difficult getting some components within vue to work are. I spent an hour and a half trying to figure out why stuff wouldn't draw to the page using that component and it was one small connection thing.
- What are you struggling with? Feeling better this week, but just exhausted. I struggle with sleeping as is, so that combined with the grind of the previous checkpoint and this one has my brain feeling pretty blasted. 
- What would you count as a victory? This is the first week in awhile I've felt confident with my skills and what i'm looking for if I need to reference something. Each day after school, my folks ask me something coding related. How many lines of code I think something in a video game would take, how they'd go about it, what makes a site work the way it does, stuff like that. Stuff I truly don't know the answer to, but it gets me thinking in a different way about how to approach assignments and look at programs.
